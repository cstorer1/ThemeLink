#picking up where we left off last year, I want to be able to do the theme comparison pipeline
#from start to finish with only two project *Theme_Coordinates.js files provided

#create launch_TC.sh with usage:
#	sh launch_TC.sh  <root_project> <compare_project>
#output: rp_cp_comparisons.pdf


#run load_TC.py <root_project> --> run format_matrix.sh <root_project>  \
#									 \__ run theme_compare.py --> comparisons.pdf
#									 /
#run load_TC.py <comp_project> --> run format_matrix.sh <comp_project>  /
#
#testing with (on AT-3):
#       /huge1/COMPBIO/STORER/Adult_Crohns_top500/Adult_Crohns_top500_Theme_Coordinates.js
#       /huge1/COMPBIO/STORER/PFD_Prot_Pos_Corr_0.75/PFD_Prot_Pos_Corr_0.75_Theme_Coordinates.js


#pull_annot.sh takes the *_Auto_Annotation.txt file as input and creates a *_Auto_Annotation.t_annot file as output
#with 30 character theme titles through theme 50  
#This now needs to be fed into comparison_heatmap.R for both root and comparison projects
